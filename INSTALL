INSTALL SITE LOGGER
-------------------

The site_logger plugin requires the 'engines' plugin installed.  http://rails-engines.org/download.  Follow the directions on that site to properly install the engines plugin.

To install into your rails application simply copy the site_logger folder into the 'vendor/plugins' folder.

The site_logger plugin has its own database table to store the log data, run the following command to migrate.

> rake dmt:site_logger:migrate

The following line is required to get the routes to work for the plugin.

config/routes.rb
> map.from_plugin :site_logger



INSTALL ENGINES
---------------
The following line is required to get the engines plugin to work properly.  Insert it after the other require at the top of the file.

config/environment.rb
> require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')



USAGE
-----
Add the following line inside controllers that should be logged.

> dmt_site_logger

All of the arguments passed to this function are passed on to the before_filter, so to omit logging for secret_page and page2:

> dmt_site_logger, :except => ['secret_page', 'page2']

You may want to disable logging for various conditions: such as all AJAX requests.  Simply add a before_filter with the following code.

> if require.xhr?
>   dmt_site_logger_disable
> end
